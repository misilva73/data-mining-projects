# Data Mining projects

This repository contains the work I did for 2 courses from NOVA-IMS, namely Data Mining I and Data Mining II. The courses were taught in SAS Miner and thus most of work is done there. Additionally, in all projects, I have done some explorations and plots in R. Finally, all projects have the problem statement and the final report in the `documents` folder.

There are three projects:

1. **Data Exploration:** This was a small "warm-up" project in which we received a dataset and had to do some simple data exploration and feature engineering
2. **Supervised:** In this project, we received a dataset from a store and we had to build a model to predict client behaviour for a marketing campaing. It included the full Data Science development loop - data exploration, feature engineering, feature selection, training and validation (via cross-validation)
3. **Unsupervised:** In this project, we add to do a clustering analysis of the clients of an insurance company. Particularly, the goal was to create a customer segmentattion that could help the marketing team better understand its customersâ€™ profiles.
